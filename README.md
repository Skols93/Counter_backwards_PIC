# Counter_backwards_PIC
----
A description of a counter that counts backward, with time set using buttons:

## Key Components:
---

Display: A visual element to show the remaining time, a 7-segment display multiplexed to reduce the pin count of the microcontroller.
Input buttons: Buttons to set the desired time, including:
Buttons for incrementing and decrementing minutes and seconds (or hours, if applicable).
A "Start" button to initiate the countdown.
Timer mechanism: A system to track and decrement the time using:
A PIC microcontroller  with internal timers for accuracy.

Functionality:

  Time Setting:
      The user presses the input buttons to specify the desired countdown time (minutes and seconds).
      The display reflects the set time.
  Countdown Initiation:
      The user presses the "Start" button.
      The timer mechanism begins decrementing the time.
  Countdown Display:
        The display continuously updates to show the remaining time.
  Countdown Completion:
        When the time reaches zero, the timer mechanism typically triggers an action:
        Audible alert (e.g., buzzer, beep)
  

  Additional Features (Optional):

        Pause/Resume: Buttons to pause and resume the countdown.
        Reset: A button to stop the countdown and reset the timer to the initial setting.
       
  External connectivity: Integration with other devices or systems for control or data exchange.
  
## Common Applications:

Kitchen timers for cooking
Exercise timers for workouts
Task timers for productivity
Game timers for competitions
